# 1D_signal_upsampling_and_denoising

## About this repository
In this repository, low-resolution and noisy 1D signals including Gaussian peaks (e.g., molecular spectra, time-of-flight depth data, and possibly others) will be denoised and upsampled using a deep-learning model that is based on a stack of residual blocks and a point-shuffle method. The architecture of the used model is the same as the one reported in [[1](https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-61-9-f15)].
